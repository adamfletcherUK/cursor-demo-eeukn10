# 3. Technical Approach

### Technology Stack
- **Front-end**: React with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **Back-end**: Python with FastAPI for rapid development and automatic API documentation
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity and ease of setup

### High-Level Architecture
Simple monolithic architecture with:
- React frontend for user interface
- FastAPI backend for business logic and data management
- SQLite database for data persistence
- RESTful API communication between frontend and backend
- No authentication layer required

### Data Model
Key entities:
1. Workshops (title, description, capacity, date, time, location)
2. Attendees (name, email)
3. Registrations (linking attendees to workshops)

   Given I am viewing a workshop with available capacity
   When I submit my registration details
   Then I should be registered for the workshop
   And receive a confirmation

   Scenario: Workshop is at capacity
   Given a workshop is at full capacity
   When I try to register
   Then I should see a notification that registration is full

   Scenario: Canceling registration

     - Search and filter controls
     - Export functionality

### Development Approach
- Start with backend API development for each milestone
- Follow with frontend implementation
- Add logging throughout for debugging
- Focus on simple, functional UI components
- Regular testing of end-to-end flows

### Testing Strategy
- Manual testing of core flows
- Console-based debugging
- Basic integration tests for critical paths
- User acceptance testing for core features

# 5. Risk Assessment & Constraints

### Potential Risks
1. **Peak Registration Load**: 
   - Mitigation Strategy: Implement registration queuing if needed

2. **Date/Time Conflicts**: 
   - Mitigation Strategy: Add validation and visual indicators for scheduling conflicts

### Constraints
- No authentication required - simple name-based registration
- Limited to basic workshop management features
- Focus on core functionality over advanced features

# 6. Success Criteria & Measurement

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Number of workshops successfully created
2. Number of successful registrations
3. User satisfaction with the registration process

### Goals for Proof of Concept
- Demonstrate end-to-end workshop creation and registration flow
- Show accurate attendance tracking and reporting
- Validate the basic user experience for both hosts and attendees
- Confirm technical feasibility of the core features
