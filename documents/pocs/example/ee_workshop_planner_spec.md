# 4. Technical Approach

### Technology Stack
- **Front-end**: React with TypeScript (modern, type-safe, widely used)
- **Back-end**: Node.js with Express (JavaScript ecosystem consistency)
- **Database**: SQLite (lightweight, self-contained, perfect for PoC)
- **Other Tools**: 
  - GitHub for version control

### High-Level Architecture
Modern web application following a client-server architecture:
- Single Page Application (SPA) frontend
- RESTful API backend
- Simple session management using browser storage
- Local development setup for easy testing and demonstration

### Data Model
Key Entities:
1. Users
   - Name
   - Email

2. Workshops
   - Title, description, datetime
   - Location
   - Capacity
   - Creator email
   - Status (upcoming/completed)
   - Last updated timestamp

3. Registrations
   - User email
   - Workshop reference
   - Status (confirmed/cancelled)
   - Timestamp

# 5. Implementation Plan

### Milestones 
1. **Foundation Setup**: 
   - Expected Deliverable: Project setup, basic user session management, core API structure

2. **Core Features Implementation**: 
   - Expected Deliverable: Workshop listing, registration system, creator dashboard

3. **Enhancement & Testing**: 
   - Expected Deliverable: UI polish, performance optimization, thorough testing

# 6. Risk Assessment & Constraints

### Potential Risks
1. **Load Management**: 
   - Mitigation Strategy: Implement client-side caching and rate limiting for API calls

2. **Data Consistency**: 
   - Mitigation Strategy: Add version control for workshop data to handle concurrent updates

### Constraints
- Simple user identification via email (no authentication required)
- User experience must be intuitive for both technical and non-technical users
- Mobile responsiveness is essential
- All users can create and attend workshops
- Local-first development for easy setup and demonstration

# 7. Success Criteria & Measurement

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Number of successful workshop registrations
2. User satisfaction ratings
3. System uptime and performance metrics
4. Workshop attendance rate

### Goals for Proof of Concept
- Successful end-to-end workshop creation and registration flow
- Handling of at least 50 concurrent users
- < 3 second response time for all main operations
- Zero double-bookings or registration conflicts
