Please analyze the specified user story in the supplied file and implement the 'Technical Design' as follows:

1. First, outline your understanding of:
   - The specific requirements from this story
   - How this feature integrates with existing functionality
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites

2. Perform a codebase analysis focusing on:
   - Existing patterns and conventions to follow
   - Similar features that can serve as templates
   - Integration points for the new feature
   - Reusable components or utilities

3. Provide an implementation plan including:
   - Component/file structure
   - Required changes to existing code
   - New components/modules to be created
   - Database changes (if any)
   - API endpoints (if any)

4. For the implementation:
   - Follow existing code conventions and patterns
   - Maintain consistent naming and structure
   - Add appropriate error handling

5. Verification checklist:
   - List each requirement from the user story
   - Confirm implementation status of each requirement
   - Note any assumptions or decisions made

Constraints:
- Maintain consistency with existing codebase
- Follow established patterns and standards
```

A useful follow-up prompt:

```
check `@story-file` against the implementation and let me know what is missing. give me a detailed breakdown of what has been implemented and what is missing before continuing 
```
