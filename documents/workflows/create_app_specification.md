# Proof of Concept (PoC) Application Specification Template

Instructions for the AI:

- Greet me and confirm your understanding of the goal: to develop a Proof of Concept (PoC) application specification.
- Use the structured template below as a guideline.
- Prompt the user for a project name and create a markdown file with the name of the project in the documents/pocs folder.
- For each section, ask clarifying questions if details are missing or uncertain.
- Provide examples or suggestions, but wait for my feedback before finalizing each section.
- Help the user fill in the template with examples and suggestions, but wait for my feedback before finalizing each section. 
    - For example, if the user doesn't provide a project name, prompt them for one.
    - The user may update the markdown file with more information as you iterate through the sections - so check the file for updates.
- Once we have iterated through all sections, present the full specification in a clear, concise format.
- Don't add Testing & Quality Assurance sections
